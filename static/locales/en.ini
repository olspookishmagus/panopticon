faq-text.innerHTML = <h4>How often is hackerspace open?</h4><p>In theory the space is open 24/7. But if you want to be 100% sure you can check the events. If there is an event happening, then the space is definitely open. You can also check the counter on the top of the website, which is auto-updated with the current number of connected devices to the hackerspace network. And of course you can always call.</p><h4>If I don't know any operator or community member can I come?</h4><p>Of course! The space is open for everyone. If that's your first time here you can introduce yourself on arrival to get a short tour from an operator. And don't forget to read our <a href="#/vision/">vision</a>.</p><h4>What should I do to organize an event at the hackerspace?</h4><p>Hackerspace is open to host any event which aligns with our <a href="#/vision/">vision</a>. The important thing is to find one of the operators, who can open the space for the event. This can happen in person at the hackerspace, or through our <a href="https://lists.hackerspace.gr/listinfo/discuss" target="_blank">discussion mailing list</a> by sending an email explaining your event idea. Once you find an operator she/he can help you creating the event on the website and guide you through any logistics.</p><h4>If I'm not a hacker can I come?</h4><p>Hacking is about sharing and curiosity. Don't get intimidated by the term. If you are interested in sharing your knowledge or learn from others, then hackerspace is definitely the place to be. Our inspiration is the Open Source philosophy.</p><h4>What does the space offers? What should I bring with me?</h4><p>Besides getting to know and interact with interesting people and a vibrant community, the space offers free internet access, books and magazines you can read, workbenches and a great variety of tools and machinery. What you should bring is the will to communicate, share and optionally your laptop. You will also find the necessary infrastructure to get your caffeine fix and a fridge full of beers and beverages.</p><h4>Who cleans up the space?</h4><p>Everybody, including you. You are free to use anything available from the kitchen (coffee machines, glasses, dishes, etc). But remember, you should clean what you used and you should leave the space cleaner than you found it.</p>

vision-title = Vision
vision-text.innerHTML = <p>Hackerspace.gr [HSGR] is a place for creativity, collaboration, research, development and, of course, education. It is more than just a physical space: It is a dynamic community with ideas inspired by the Open Source philosophy.</p><h3>The Idea</h3><p>Every day through internet we share data and perceptions, problems and solutions, from our home or work. So, why not do it face to face as well? The idea is derived from Free / Open-Source Software culture and from the desire to share our experiences and knowledge. We want to share our ideas, exactly like we share our code.</p><h3>Values</h3><h4>Open Source</h4><p>The basic operetional principle of the Hackerspace is that we share projects, code, ideas that we produce inside that space, in collaboration with each other. This requires that all these are distributed freely with relevant license whether it's code, schematics, constructions, content.</p><h4>Non Profit</h4><p>We operate in a non-profit manner and we mainly support like-minded projects and initiatives. Participation on all projects, events, but also in the day-to-day operation of the Hackerspace, is free and open to all.</p><h4>Code of Conduct</h4><p>Be polite to everyone. Respect all people that you meet at the space, as well as the space itself. Everyone is welcome. Hackerspace is a safe place for all people, regardless of age, race, gender, appearance or linux distribution.</p><h4>Consensus</h4><p>All of our decisions are the result of consensus among operators. Operators are responsible for the everyday needs of the Hackerspace. Decisions take place at the assembly meetings, which are open to everyone.</p><h4>Do-ocracy</h4><p>Nobody needs a permission to work on a project. Anyone that wants to organize an event or a workshop, that is aligned with Hackerspace principles and vision, doesn't need to wait for someone else to do it. She can take the initiative and and do it.</p>
